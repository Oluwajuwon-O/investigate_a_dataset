>- `AppointmentID`: identification of each appointment
>- `Gender`: Male or Female
>- `ScheduledDay`: The day of actual appointment
>- `AppointmentDay`: The day someone called or registered the appointment
>- `Age`: How old the patient is
>- `Neigbbourhood`: Where the appointment takes place
>- `Scholarship`: True or False
>- `Hypertension`: True or False
>- `Alcoholism`: True or False
>- `Handicap`: True or False
>- `SMS_received`: 1 or more messages sent to the patient
>- `No-show`: True or False
